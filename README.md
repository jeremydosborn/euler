=====

Working through the Euler problem set in Python 2.7 (https://projecteuler.net/problems).

This is a fun learning project, so I have not looked up other people's solutions to these problems; the code here is my own unless explicitly stated otherwise.

As of now, I have not refactored any of these solutions for performance; I'll come back this in the future.
