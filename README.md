Working through the Euler problem set in Python 2.7 (https://projecteuler.net/problems).

Because I am working through this problem set for fun, and for learning, I have not looked up other people's solutions to these problems, so the code here is my own, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

As of now, I have not refactored any of these solutions for performance, though I plan to come back to this at a later date.
